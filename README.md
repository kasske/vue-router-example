# Vue router example

Vue js mini project messing around with vue router

It showcases the:

- router
- routes
- nested routes
- routerview
- routerlink
- programatic navigation
- route params
- query params
- redirecting 
- named routes
- multiple routes per page (named routes)
- navigation guards

The app is a dummy app, it doesn't have meaningful logic, it just showcases the usage of those mentioned above
